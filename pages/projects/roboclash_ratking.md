# Project Summary
Before the start of my term in 2024, I decided to be ambitious and participate in the annual Roboclash competition, held every year at SUTD. I joined in as a pair with a friend of mine (though the recommended team size was four), and immediately got to work on building a drone that can pick up objects. The objectives of Roboclash was to build a robot entirely from scratch that could not only pick up items, but deposit them in collection points, and that was what we set out to do! We signed up under the name 'Rat King', which was to be the name of our robot.

# My Involvement
We had a tough road ahead of us from the get go due to our small team size and the fact that we joined in late. I was in charge of programming the Arduino chip to control the motors in the robot, while my friend was in charge of fabricating the drone's physical hull.

It was tough; I had no clue how to program an Arduino chip. What was worse, I spent the past two weeks programming an ESP32 chip instead (which ended up not working for our use case...) Eventually we did get it to work, as we were able to interface it with the RC controller lent to us by the competition organizers. With the programming done, I had to handle the software-to-hardware integration as well, as I was the one who was familiar with the specifications of my code. My friend was a big help in piecing it all together too; I had never handled electronics before too, so this was completely new for me.

# What I Learnt
First things first, I learnt not to join competitions late, AND to assemble a proper team before going in. But I learned a lot during this trial by fire! Arduino, software-to-hardware integration as well as fabrication (I helped out with laser-cutting as well, it's actually where I first began learning how to use the laser-cutting machine!) We were unfortunately unable to participate in the competition, as we couldn't confidently field the robot. On the day of the event itself, we had only managed to build the hull and set up its internal wirings, and we had absolutely no time to test or calibrate our robot's motors. With the machine completely untested (we didn't even know if it would work at all), we decided to withdraw from the competition to make way for other teams. It was a regrettable decision that cost me and my friend a lot of sleepless nights, but I do not regret participating and learning all these new skills.
