# Project Summary
This project concerns the open garden acting as a connector between the hostel blocks in my university. It was chosen due to the dull and unassuming space and the constant exposure to the Sun turning it into an open-air sauna during the day. So, within the six of us in one group, we tried to transform the garden into a more aesthetically pleasing space while also providing comfort from direct sunlight and high temperatures.

# My Involvement
I was in charge of two things:
1. Fabrication
	-  I worked with one of my group mates; while they prototyped the different surfaces for the supertree, I was in charge of fabricating the patterns onto a plywood surface. We initially attempted to use acrylic, but it was too fragile and cracked easily, hence the material swap from acrylic to plywood. ![alt text](/assets/cld/owie.jpg "This didn't work.")
	-  The aim was to find a pattern that gives the plywood flexibility, while also ensuring it remains robust enough that it doesn't break easily. Once the pattern was decided, then it was only a matter of cutting it out to be attached to the supertree stems.![alt text](/assets/cld/demo_draft.jpg "The functional prototype in the midst of being built.")
2.  Virtual 3D Modeling
	-  Part of the project deliverables was to build a virtual demo of the site as well. I handled this in Sketchup with initial drafts using the V-Ray rendering engine, a plugin for Sketchup. Once the environment was modelled and accurately rendered, the project file would be handed over to my group mate, who animated its use case and touched up the site further in Twinmotion.![alt text](/assets/cld/CLD_day.png "Take a look!")

# What I Learnt
I used some fabrication skills I learned from my experience building my drone for Roboclash 2024, but 3D modeling using Sketchup was new to me. I only had previous experience with Rhino for a prior university module, so I had to throw myself into a crash course learning how to use Sketchup and its plugins in order to ensure all the deliverables were ready before the project showcase. Thankfully, I was able to complete my part of the work in time, ensuring there weren't any delays in getting all the deliverables ready for the showcase.
