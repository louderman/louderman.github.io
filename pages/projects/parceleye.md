# Project Summary  

This project was done as part of my mobile development module, and the goal of the app was to use an external camera and AI to detect, track, and monitor parcels. The app was designed specifically for Android phones, using Java and XML, and it aimed to assist users by turning their phone into a visual parcel tracker without needing to manually scan anything themselves. The AI and camera functionality handled that part, giving users a quick, automated tracking experience.

# My Involvement  
I was mainly in charge of the frontend development, and worked on building the user interface of the app using Java and XML. This included the layout, screen transitions, and making sure the UI felt responsive and intuitive. While I wasn't involved in the backend database or the AI side of things, I coordinated with those members to ensure that the UI elements displayed the right information and handled state changes properly. 

This project was also my first time working with other members in a collaborative app project on GitHub. There were issues with merging at first, due to minor overlap with the merges my groupmate made, but thankfully it was fixable. Here's a video of the app at work.

# What I Learnt  
This was my first time building an Android app as part of a team, and it gave me a clearer understanding of how collaborative development on GitHub actually works. I got a better grasp of version control, how to resolve merge conflicts, and how to build on someone else's code without breaking their features. It was also great practice in UI layout design for Android, and it taught me how to structure a project cleanly when working across multiple screens and components.
