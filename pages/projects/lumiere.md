# Project Summary
This project was for an architecture module I took alongside my programming classes, and the objective of this project was to reimagine an object (usually old) with a future use case and theming. We picked out the Akari Lights, and the focus of our theme was the icy oceans of Europa. The idea behind this project was to stretch our imagination and attempt to pick out already existing objects, and use our creativity to rebuild it with a completely new environment in mind.

# My Involvement
Part of the project's objectives was to make use of AI image generators to help reimagine these objects into something new. Alongside a group mate, the two of us were in charge of AI art generation. I had prior experience with using AI image generators and so did my group mate, so this was a breeze. The trouble came from using NeRF to create a 3D model to build it using purely synthetic images.

It wasn't very satisfactory, and experimenting with it further yielded worse results. The website we used to convert images into NeRF did not work well with completely synthetic images, often leading to flat models or 'patchy' models that simply wasn't serviceable. We had to resort to using an AI-generated image as a base and model it manually in Rhino3D. I was the one handling NeRF, while my other partner ended up doing the manual modelling instead.

Next up was the presentation. The massive presentation/report was a group effort, but I focused on animating a video to show off how the flower lamp would be used in the future environment we picked. The entire video was completely hand-drawn without any AI, using my prior art and animation skills to bring imagination into reality.

# What I Learnt
Personally, I used this project to practice animation and to integrate my own personal skills to polish its presentation. My programming skills weren't of much use here (another groupmate was already handling the functional prototype), so it was the perfect opportunity to use my art and animation prowess for a school project!
